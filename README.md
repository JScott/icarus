# Places of interest

I think a lot of the interesting work I did was in the terrain generation so take a look at how I do diamond-square. It was a long time ago so I'm sorry if the code is horrible :(

Originally I was looking at a Terraria-like game with bigger blocks. This was before Terraria was out, mind you. Feel free to run with that idea because it was almost more impressive with the way I did lighting.
