              The goal for Icarus was to develop a roleplaying experience that told a story through gameplay instead of despite it. When I play most games in the genre I feel like there's a cognitive dissonance between the dialogue and combat. It's as if I'm playing two different games that are only tangentially related and the whole is lesser than the sum of its parts. In Icarus I transcend this problem by eschewing the crutch of dialogue trees and having choices based directly on the player's actions.

              Additionally, I wanted to explore the theme of power not only through plot but also through game mechanics. Because of this, the game features "second hand" combat where Icarus can't directly attack enemies but commands a companion who is very powerful. I wanted to grant the player power but also have that power be fickle and see what interesting gameplay and choices spring forth.
